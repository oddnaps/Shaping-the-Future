% Script to shape the future

% Step 1: Set up parameters
% Parameters used to define the future
n_years = 10; % Ten-year horizon
popgrowth = 0.03; % Population growth rate
gdpgrowth = 0.04; % GDP growth rate

% Step 2: Calculate the future population and GDP
% Initialize the population and GDP
pop = 5000000;
gdp = 300000000;

% Calculate the future population and GDP
for i = 1:n_years
    pop = pop + pop*popgrowth;
    gdp = gdp + gdp*gdpgrowth;
end

% Report the results
fprintf('Population at end of 10 years: %.2f million\n', pop/1e6);

% Step 3: Identify challenges and opportunities
% Identify issues that need to be addressed

% Identify opportunities that can be seized

% Step 4: Develop a plan
% Create a plan to shape the future

% Increase access to education

% Step 5: Monitor progress
% Monitor progress and ensure the plan is being implemented
